### Problem statement:
In the manufacturing industry, there is 12 hours shift pattern which consists of the day shift and night shift.

Between the shift, there will be a handover (passing down issues or concerns during the working shift). As the current practice, the operator/technician only passes down the issue through the team's chat or face-to-face, which leads to some miscommunication or overlooks of the issues.

### Solution:
An app that is able to check and update stakeholders (operators & technicians) on the ongoing issue

### Tools:
- Figma (wireframe)
- Flutter (app)
